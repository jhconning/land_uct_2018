### Jupyter Notebooks

A jupyter notebook provides a visual frontend for combining text, math, code and visual ouputs in a notebook form.

This folder contains a number of Jupyter notebooks of possible relevance to the course.  
Some are directly relevant to material covered in class, others are relevant only to material or articles
mentioned in passing. 

If you click on one the ipynb files in the folder you will be led to a static (i.e. non-interactive) html rendering of the notebook. 

To run the notebooks interactively you can run them on your own jupyter notebook installation on a local machine, 
or in the cloud using a free service such as such as Microsoft Azure notebooks or Google Colaboratory.
